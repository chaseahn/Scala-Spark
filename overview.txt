Spark

- Open source on Apache
- Flexible alternative to MapReduce

Spark vs. MapReduce

- MapReduce write most data to disk after each map reduce operation
- Spark keeps most of the data in memory after transformation
- Spark can spill over to disk if the memory is filled

Spark RDDs

- At the core Spark is the idea of a Resilient Districuted Dataset (SDD)
- RDD had 4 main features
    * Distributed collection of Data
    * Fault-tolerant
    * Parallel operation - partioned
    * Ability to use many data sources
- Two types of RDD operations: Transformations, Actions
    * tranformations - recipes to follow
    * actions - perform what the recipe says to do and returns something back
